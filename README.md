Project Specifications

The project enables the users to do the following features:

The system shall allow the user to input:
- The Number of Items
- Area Coverage (expected),
- Unit Price (per day), and
- Due Date, the day on which the deal is done, and Dueback Date, the expected date of returning the product.

The system shall produce precise calculations of:
- The total price of the items to be credited and/or purchased - including VAT.
- The date difference between Due and Dueback Dates.

The system shall produce an Item Report - a report of total items that are categorized as available, on-loan, in-maintenance, or soon available. This should also contain Dueback dates for items that are in maintenance and soon-available categories.

Beyond the above features, we believe the system has to include the proper authentication and authorization features required.
